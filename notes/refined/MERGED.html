<li><strong>SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)</strong> architecture is a type of parallel computing architecture that performs the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.</li>
<li>In a SIMD architecture, multiple processing elements execute the same operation on different pieces of data at the same time, thereby achieving data-level parallelism.</li>
<li>Two common forms of SIMD architectures are <strong>vector processors</strong> and <strong>array processors</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Array Processors</strong>: In array processors, instructions operate on multiple data elements simultaneously using different processing elements. This form of SIMD architecture is characterized by having multiple processing elements that perform the same operation at the same time across different sets of data.</li>
<li><strong>Vector Processors</strong>: Vector processors use a single instruction to perform operations on data stored in vector registers. These registers can hold multiple data elements, and a single instruction can operate on all these elements sequentially or in parallel, depending on the architecture.
<img src="../images/Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 21.36.37.png" alt="SIMD architecture"/></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>GPU</strong> represents a hybrid of array and vector processor architectures.</li>
<li>The <strong>SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architecture</strong> utilizes registers that store vectors, which are arrays of N elements of M bits each, instead of single scalar values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simd-vs-out-of-order-execution">SIMD vs Out-of-Order Execution:</h3>
<h4 id="simd">SIMD</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parallel Data Processing</strong>: SIMD allows a single instruction to simultaneously perform the same operation on multiple data points. This is particularly beneficial for tasks that can be parallelized at the data level, such as vector and matrix operations common in graphics, multimedia processing, and scientific computations.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: By executing one instruction across many data elements, SIMD reduces the instruction cycle overhead, leading to better utilization of processing power for suitable tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>: Executing multiple operations simultaneously can be more energy-efficient than processing them serially, which is particularly valuable in mobile and embedded applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialized Use Cases</strong>: SIMD is most effective when operations are uniform and can be applied simultaneously to multiple pieces of data. It is less useful for general-purpose computing where each data element might require different operations.</li>
<li><strong>Programming Complexity</strong>: Utilizing SIMD often requires explicit programming effort, including managing data alignment and handling cases where data sizes do not match SIMD register widths.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="out-of-order-execution">Out-of-Order Execution</h4>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased CPU Utilization</strong>: Out-of-order execution allows CPUs to make more efficient use of processor cycles by executing instructions as resources become available, rather than adhering strictly to the program order.</li>
<li><strong>Latency Hiding</strong>: It helps in hiding the latency of slower operations like memory fetch and long arithmetic operations by rearranging the execution order to keep the execution units busy.</li>
<li><strong>General Purpose</strong>: This approach is beneficial for a wide range of applications, as it automatically optimizes execution without special programming requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: The CPU design becomes significantly more complex with out-of-order execution, which can increase the cost and power consumption of the processor.</li>
<li><strong>Diminishing Returns</strong>: For highly sequential code or when dependencies between instructions are too tight, the advantages of out-of-order execution can be limited.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="comparison">Comparison</h4>
<ul>
<li>SIMD and out-of-order execution are complementary techniques that address different aspects of parallelism and efficiency in computing.</li>
<li>SIMD is well-suited for tasks with data-level parallelism, while out-of-order execution is more effective for improving the utilization of CPU resources and handling complex instruction dependencies.</li>

<h4 id="data-processing-in-simd-architectures">Data Processing in SIMD Architectures:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vector processors</strong> handle data serially from vector registers:
<ul>
<li>Each cycle processes one element from the vector through a functional unit (FU) until all vector elements are processed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Array processors</strong> handle entire vectors simultaneously:
<ul>
<li>Performs operations like LOAD, ADD, and STORE on all elements at the same time, necessitating multiple FUs.</li>

<h4 id="example-of-operational-differences">Example of Operational Differences:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>To add two vectors of 32 elements:</strong>

<li>An <strong>array processor</strong> would perform 32 LOADs, 32 ADDs, and 32 STOREs concurrently, requiring 32 FUs.</li>
<li>A <strong>vector processor</strong> would sequentially perform:
<ul>
<li>LOAD0, then LOAD1 and ADD0, followed by LOAD2, ADD1, and STORE0, continuing in this fashion, utilizing fewer resources but at a slower rate.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>To program a vector machine, the compiler or hand coder must make the data structures in the code fit nearly exactly the regular structure built into the hardware. That's hard to do in first place, and just as hard to change. One tweak, and the low-level code has to be rewritten by a very smart and dedicated programmer who knows the hardware and often the subtleties of the application area.</p>

<ul>
<li>In GPU parlance, a thread is a single sequence of programmed instructions that operates on an independent set of data.</li>
<li>Logical vs. Physical Resources: A thread is not directly a piece of physical hardware. Instead, it is a logical execution unit that the GPU's hardware can manage. Threads are mapped to physical hardware resources when they are scheduled for execution.</li>
<li>Execution Context: Each thread has its own execution context, which includes:
<ul>
<li>Registers: Each thread has access to a set of registers.</li>
<li>Local memory (if any): Threads may also have access to small amounts of local memory specific to that thread.</li>
<li>Program Counter: Each thread does not independently possess a physical program counter. Instead, all threads in a <strong>warp</strong> share the same instruction stream and thus follow the same program counter for their execution path.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programming-model-vs-execution-model">Programming Model vs. Execution Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Programming model</strong>: How the programmer writes the code, can be:

<li>Sequential (von Neumann)</li>
<li>Data parallel (SIMD)</li>
<li>Dataflow</li>
<li>Multi-threaded (MIMD, SPMD)</li>
</ul>

<li>Array processor</li>
<li>Dataflow processor</li>
<li>Multiprocessor</li>

<li>In practice, a GPU is a SIMD machine without the need for SIMD instructions; it is programmed using THREADs (SPMD programming model).
<ul>
<li>Each thread executes the same code but on different data.</li>
<li>Each thread maintains its own context and can be used, reset, and executed independently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A set of threads executing the same instruction are dynamically grouped into <strong>WARPs (wavefront)</strong> by the hardware.</li>
<li>GPUs can be viewed as SIMD machines not exposed to the programmer (SIMT = single instruction multiple threads).</li>

<h4 id="how-do-they-operate">How do they operate</h4>
<ul>
<li>Uniform Instruction Execution: All threads in a warp execute the same instruction at once but on different pieces of data. This design leverages the data parallelism that GPUs are optimized for, such as in graphics rendering or scientific computations where the same operations are performed over a large set of data elements.</li>
<li>Handling Divergence: If threads within a warp need to execute different instructions (due to conditional branching, for instance), this causes what's known as &quot;warp divergence.&quot; The GPU handles divergence by serially executing each branch path needed by any thread in the warp, while other threads wait (idle). This can lead to inefficiencies and is one of the challenges in optimizing GPU code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="warp-and-thread-management">Warp and Thread Management:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Execution</strong>: Because all threads in a warp execute the same instruction simultaneously, they can be thought of as sharing a single program counter at the level of the warp. This means if threads need to execute different instructions because of conditional branching, the warp must serialize these branches, handling each outcome path one at a time, which can lead to inefficiencies.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Allocation</strong>: The CUDA cores (hardware execution units) do not belong to any specific thread permanently. They are allocated dynamically to threads as warps are scheduled to execute. This means the hardware resources are shared and managed across potentially thousands of threads.</li>

<p><a href="19_SIMD.md#disadvantages-of-vector-processors">See here</a></p>
<h3 id="limits-of-simt-architecture">Limits of SIMT Architecture</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thread Divergence:</strong> In SIMT architectures like those in GPUs, thread divergence remains a challenge. When threads within the same warp choose different execution paths due to conditional branching, the GPU must execute each path serially, which diminishes the benefits of parallel execution.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Contention:</strong> SIMT architectures can suffer from resource contention when multiple threads attempt to access memory or other shared resources simultaneously, leading to potential bottlenecks and reduced performance.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Memory Hierarchy Management:</strong> SIMT architectures typically involve a complex memory hierarchy including local, shared, and global memory. Efficiently managing data across these memories is crucial for performance but adds to programming complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization Costs:</strong> While SIMT allows each thread to execute independently, synchronization mechanisms are necessary to coordinate threads, especially when they need to share data. Implementing synchronization correctly is crucial but can be error-prone and impact performance.</li>
<li><strong>Software Complexity:</strong> Although SIMT provides more flexibility than SIMD, it still requires careful programming to avoid performance pitfalls such as warp divergence and inefficient memory access patterns. The need to manage execution at the thread level can complicate software design and optimization.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="comparison-and-context">Comparison and Context</h4>
<p>While SIMD is more restrictive due to its need for uniform operations across all data elements, SIMT provides more flexibility by allowing each thread to execute independently. However, both architectures need careful management of memory access patterns and data alignment to prevent performance degradation. The choice between SIMD and SIMT typically depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application, as well as the underlying hardware's capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="why-cuda-gpus-is-better-than-simd">Why CUDA (GPUs) is better than SIMD</h2>
<ul>
<li>As discussed in the <a href="./19_SIMD.md">SIMD section</a>, the main pain point is that SIMD is:
<ul>
<li>Not flexible (VLEN required)</li>
<li>Not easy to program</li>

<li>CUDA allows for a dynamic allocation of resources depending on the workload, enhancing flexibility in programming diverse applications.</li>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>New programming model: new and existing developers must learn to think in parallel terms and adapt traditional serial code to take full advantage of GPU capabilities.</li>
<li>Algorithms need to be re-implemented and rethought</li>
<li>Still has some bottlenecks
<ul>
<li>CPU-GPU communication (PCIe bus, NVLink)</li>
<li>DRAM memory bandwidth (GDDR5, GDDR6, HBM2)
<ul>
<li>Even though modern gpu's memory bandwidth is very high (300-900 GB/s), it's still a bottleneck and far from the theoretical peak of the GPU.</li>
<li>The # of cores &amp; how powerful these cores are is higher than the memory bandwidth -&gt; GPUs are more powerful but this ratio is worse than 30 years ago.</li>
<li>Data layout: inefficient data layouts can lead to poor memory access patterns that exacerbate bandwidth limitations.</li>

<li>Performance optimizations are often hardware-specific, meaning that code optimized for one generation of GPUs may not perform as well on another, requiring ongoing maintenance and updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cpu-vs-gpu">CPU vs GPU</h2>
<p>Different philosophies:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: a few <strong>out-of-order</strong> cores</li>
<li>GPU: Many <strong>in-order</strong> FGMT (Fine Grained MultiThreading)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>CPUs are designed to minimize latency for a small set of instructions at a time. This design is optimized for general-purpose computing where tasks often have complex dependency chains.</li>
<li>Out-of-order execution allows CPU cores to execute instructions as soon as the operands are available, rather than adhering to the original program order. This improves the efficiency of instruction pipelines by filling in execution stalls caused by instruction dependencies.
<ul>
<li>Requires complex hardware to manage instruction reordering and ensure correct program execution.</li>
<li>Due to the complexity of out-of-order execution, CPUs have fewer cores (powerful cores) and are optimized for single-threaded performance rather than parallelism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gpu">GPU</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on throughput rather than latency. They are optimized for workloads that can be divided into many smaller operations that can be processed simultaneously</li>
<li>GPU cores generally execute instructions in the order they are received, simplifying the hardware design and allowing for many more cores to be packed onto a single chip.</li>
<li>To handle the in-order execution without suffering from latency issues, GPUs use fine-grained multithreading. This approach allows each core to switch between multiple threads in a single cycle, thus hiding execution latency caused by long-running operations or memory accesses.</li>
<li>GPUs contain hundreds to thousands of simpler cores. Smaller cores are more power-efficient and can be packed more densely onto a chip, allowing for massive parallelism.</li>

<h3 id="performance-considerations">Performance considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main bottlenecks</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global memory access</strong> (the main GPU memory) is often a significant bottleneck due to its relatively high latency and limited bandwidth compared to the compute capabilities of the GPU cores.</li>
<li><strong>CPU-GPU data transfers</strong> over the PCIe bus can substantially affect performance, particularly for applications that require frequent data exchanges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory access</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Latency hiding</strong>
<ul>
<li>Occupancy refers to the number of warps that are active on a multiprocessor at a given time. Higher occupancy can help hide the latency of memory access because while some threads are waiting for data to arrive from memory, others can be executing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Memory coalescing</strong> refers to the optimization technique where adjacent threads access consecutive memory addresses. When memory access is coalesced, multiple data elements can be loaded in a single memory transaction, which reduces the number of required memory accesses and improves bandwidth utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Data reuse</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared memory usage</strong> can significantly reduce the reliance on slower global memory. Shared memory is much faster but limited in size</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SIMD (Warp) utilization
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch divergence</strong> occurs when threads of the same warp follow different execution paths due to conditional statements. This divergence can lead to serialization within the warp, where some threads are idle while others are executing, reducing overall efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Memory access patterns</strong>, crucial for maximizing throughput.
<ul>
<li>Strided accesses, where threads access memory locations that are spaced apart, can lead to poor utilization of memory bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Atomic operations</strong> ensure that a particular memory location is updated atomically, preventing race conditions between threads.
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid them if possible</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use them sparingly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Serialization</strong>: two threads trying to write to the same memory location. One must wait for the other to complete, which can serialize the operations and degrade performance.
<ul>
<li>Overlap of communication and computation to mitigate the impact of data transfer times.
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous data transfers can help overlap communication and computation, allowing the CPU to perform other tasks while the GPU is processing data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="memory-access---latency-hiding">Memory access - Latency hiding</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>FGMT</strong> (Fine-Grained Multi-Threading) helps to hide the latency of long memory accesses by interleaving the execution of multiple threads or warps. When one warp stalls due to a memory request, another warp can take over the execution unit.</li>
<li><strong>Occupancy</strong>: It is defined as the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps that can be active per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). Basically how many warps are active at the same time.
<ul>
<li><strong>Active warps</strong>: warps that are currently executing and not stalled waiting for resources.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum warps</strong>: total number of warps that an SM can support at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum number of blocks per SM</strong>: each can typically support up to 32 blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Register usage</strong> &amp; <strong>Shared memory usage</strong>: fixed amount of register and shared memory, often around 256KB for registers and 64KB for shared memory in modern architectures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="../images/Screenshot 2024-04-27 at 15.38.09.png" alt="Memory access - Latency hiding">
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Consider a scenario where each thread block in a GPU program requires 30KB of shared memory. Given that the typical shared memory available per SM is 64KB, you can calculate the number of blocks that can fit within one SM:</p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: Since each block requires 30KB, only two blocks can be accommodated within one SM (2 * 30KB = 60KB &lt; 64KB).
Crucial because fitting more blocks might exceed the available shared memory, leading to a reduction in occupancy and potential performance degradation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occupancy Calculation
<ul>
<li><strong>Number of Threads per Block</strong>: Defined by the programmer, this affects how threads are distributed across warps and blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Number of Registers per Thread</strong>: Known at compile time, more registers per thread reduce the number of threads (and thus warps) that can be active at any one time.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Memory per Block</strong>: Also defined by the programmer, this is the amount of shared memory each block requires. High shared memory usage can limit the number of blocks per SM.</li>

<p>Each thread computes a value based on a 3x3 region of the image. As the filter moves across the image, many of these regions will overlap, meaning subsequent operations will reuse some of the same data elements.</p>
<p>What about the next 9 elements? We're going to access the same 6 elements again. This is data reuse. We do not want again to access the global memory to get the same data, if we can reuse it we can optimize the performance of the program.
Moving the filter one pixel to the right in a row means six out of the nine pixels in the new filter window are the same as in the previous window.</p>

<h5 id="optimization-techniques-for-data-reuse">Optimization techniques for data reuse</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Memory Utilization</strong>: Temporarily store data that will be reused in the shared memory of the GPU, which is much faster to access than global memory. This reduces latency and bandwidth usage on repeated accesses.</li>

<li>
<p>Typically, 32 banks in NVIDIA GPUs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successive 32-bit words are stored in successive banks</li>
<li><code>Bank = Address % 32</code></li>
<li>In an ideal scenario, each thread in a warp accesses a different bank, allowing all 32 threads to access memory concurrently without any delays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Within-Warp Conflicts:</strong> Bank conflicts occur when multiple threads in the same warp request data from the same memory bank simultaneously. This results in serialization of these memory accesses, degrading performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>If each thread accesses a separate bank, there are no conflicts, and access is maximized.</li>

So if 2 threads belonging to the same warp wanted to write to the same memory location, they have to contend for this lock, and only one of them will be able to write to the memory location.
